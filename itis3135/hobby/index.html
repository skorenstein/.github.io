                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Greetings! Overwatch is a competitive first person shooter released by blizzard enterntainment on May 24 2016. After 6 years Blizzard released Overwatch2 on October 4, 2022 which took over the original Overwatch making the original unplayable. Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 hero shooter, Each team picks 5 characters 1 tank hero, 2 damage heros, and 2 support heros. Each role is complicated in its own way but they are very distinct. Simplified, the tanks are expected to take and hold space while protecting their team, Damage heros are focused on puttign out a large volume of damage and confirming eliminations, Support heros heal and buff your team while debuffing the enemy team.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I started Playing Overwatch on Christmas Day of 2016. I had gotten the game as a Christmas present. I asked for the game because I really liked how unique the characters all looked and how they all ahd different abilites. I began playing Overwatch on the Xbox 1 and only played Genji. After making the switch to the PC version in January 2018 I picked up D.va as my new main and became a tank player. I still play a lot of D.va to this day but I have been playing a lot of Junker Queen recently.</p>

                <h2>Why I Coach</h2>
                <p>I have talked a lot about playing the game but over the past two years I have been primarily a coach. A coach has a lot of responsibilites such as helping players improve while still picking them up when they fail. I stopped playing competivley becasue the stress was having a negative effect on my mental health. Since I was coachign as well as playign at the time I decided that my skills where better used helping others improve. Seeing the peopel I coach improve and win games brings me more joy then playing ever did. I like seeign the people I work with smile and have fun while getting better. </p>

                <h2>The Coaching Experience</h2>
                <p>As a coach I have had the pleasure of working with a wide variety of people. Not just peopel of different backgrounds but different skill levels. The ranking system in Overwatch goes like this: bronze → silver → gold → platinum → diamond → master → grandmaster → champion. I have worked with players from every rank.</p>

                    <figcaption>2 of the players that I used to coach at a tournament at UNC Greensboro</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Workign with this wide of a variety has taught me a lot, not just about coaching others but about myself. When I first started I did have a set style of coaching and bounced around. Now close to 3 years later the people I coach know exactly what to expect from a coaching session. I have found that the best way to coach is to be blunt with critcism while also being open to new ideas. And explaining why thigns should be done a certain way.</p>

                <h2>How I Improved</h2>
                <p>Improving as a coach is like improving at anything else. It takes a lot of time and a lot of practice. When I started out I was so afraid of making a mistake and giving someone bad information that I ended up not helping them at all. Since then I have learned to trust myself and my understand while taking into account other peoples opinions. Something that helped me when I was starting out was watching other coaches stream on twitch. This helped me increase my knowledge of the game while also showing me how other coaches conducted themselves.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I watched professionals play and took that knowledge to my teams</li>
                    <li>Asked for feedback from the people I coached in order to improve</li>
                    <li>I watched my own games and practiced coachign myself</li>
